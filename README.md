## Phase one, lab 41
- Got a good start, manageed to get my Android emulator set up on my local machine. Ran into issues getting my VSCode and the android emulator talking. Jacob helped, it seems there is issues since I am on windows. 

- Finished lab assignment on the snack.expo.dev website since I wasnt able to host a local emulator, had to use the QR code they provide and my personal cell. Code inside this Repo is the same code I had on their site.
